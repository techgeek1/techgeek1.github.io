Welcome to the blog! This site was built to serve as a place to write on various topics since it's about time I start sharing knowledge somewhere more permanent than chat rooms. Common topics will likely include VR, programming, design (from an engineer's perspective), projects, and any ongoing research I'm working on.

Hopefully you find something of useful among my blabbering. If not, maybe you will get some ideas or a laugh out of it, who knows.
